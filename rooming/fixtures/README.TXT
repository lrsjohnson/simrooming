These fixtures hold the room info imported, like room numbers/capacities/GRT. The GRT sections were not imported and were inputted by hand.

fixfinal.json: The final JSON file containing all room info.
fixture.json: The JSON file dumped by Django, used for format. Generated by "python manage.py dumpdata"
roomformat.json: A version of fixture.json that has only relevant info about room format
gettingrooms.py: Translates room.csv to fixfinal.json
proc.py: Translates fixture.json to roomformat.json
rooms.csv: csv with room info from a spreadsheet


NOTE: There is a bug with counting the number of doubles per GRT section. Right now, the singles are counted, but they currently have "None" as GRT section. When the GRT sections for singles are updated, the system will break.
